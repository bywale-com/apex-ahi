    discoverability: Discoverable
    surface_accessibility: API
    dependencies: Browser must be launched with `persistence_id`

    afforded_action: Remote programmatic control using Playwright, Puppeteer, or CDP clients
    discoverability: Discoverable
    surface_accessibility: CDP
    dependencies: Browser session must be active; CDP port returned at launch
    automation_resistance: Low
    notes: Compatible with Chromium-based automation libraries; attaches to Kernel’s cloud-hosted browser

  - category: API
    component: Replay Recording API
    afforded_action: Record browser session as video
    discoverability: Discoverable
    surface_accessibility: API
    dependencies: Headful mode only; `browser_id` required
    automation_resistance: Low
    notes: Use `start` and `stop` endpoints to control segments; replays available via download URL for audit/debug

  - category: CLI
    component: `kernel browsers` command set
    afforded_action: Create, list, view, and delete browser sessions from terminal
    discoverability: Obvious
    surface_accessibility: CLI
    dependencies: Login via `kernel login` or API key
    automation_resistance: Low
    notes: Used in CI/CD scripts; e.g., `kernel browsers create --headless --stealth`

  - category: CLI
    component: `kernel deploy` command
    afforded_action: Deploy local codebase as a cloud agent app
    discoverability: Obvious
    surface_accessibility: CLI
    dependencies: Valid Kernel project (with manifest); CLI login
    automation_resistance: Low
    notes: Bundles code and uploads to Kernel’s infra; produces `app_id` for invocation

  - category: MCP
    component: MCP Tool: `create_browser`
    afforded_action: Launch browser from within AI assistant agent session
    discoverability: Requires Expertise
    surface_accessibility: MCP
    dependencies: MCP server integration; auth context
    automation_resistance: Low
    notes: Used by AI models to request real-time browsers during conversations; returns live view and control handles

  - category: MCP
    component: MCP Tool: `invoke_action`
    afforded_action: Trigger specific action in a deployed agent app
    discoverability: Requires Expertise
    surface_accessibility: MCP
    dependencies: Deployed app ID and named action
    automation_resistance: Low
    notes: Equivalent to `POST /apps/invoke`; allows intelligent agents to call arbitrary functions

  - category: MCP
    component: MCP Tool: `deploy_app`
    afforded_action: Upload and register app source code via AI instruction
    discoverability: Requires Expertise
    surface_accessibility: MCP
    dependencies: Requires a zipped app bundle or source repo reference
    automation_resistance: Medium
    notes: AI agents can deploy new automation flows without human intervention; powerful for autonomous development loops

  - category: Implicit
    component: Stealth Mode (flag: `stealth: true`)
    afforded_action: Route browser through residential proxy and solve CAPTCHAs automatically
    discoverability: Discoverable
    surface_accessibility: API, CLI, MCP
    dependencies: Must be passed at browser creation; cannot toggle mid-session
    automation_resistance: Low
    notes: Enables bot-evasion strategies; only available in headful mode; reduces detectability and humanizes fingerprints

  - category: Implicit
    component: Live View URL
    afforded_action: Observe and optionally control the browser session via browser-based VNC
    discoverability: Discoverable
    surface_accessibility: UI
    dependencies: Browser must be in headful mode
    automation_resistance: Low
    notes: Enables human-in-the-loop debugging; `?readOnly=true` toggle available for audit-only

  - category: Implicit
    component: Auto Snapshotting (Standby Mode)
    afforded_action: Pause inactive browser and restore later with full session context
    discoverability: Requires Expertise
    surface_accessibility: Internal (auto-managed)
    dependencies: Persistence ID; no explicit API to pause/resume
    automation_resistance: Low
    notes: Used for cost-saving and state retention; invisible to user but critical for long-running workflows

  - category: Latent
    component: Rehydration-from-Invocation ID
    afforded_action: Reconnect to previous browser session tied to a specific task
    discoverability: Hidden
    surface_accessibility: API
    dependencies: `invocation_id` or `persistence_id`
    automation_resistance: Medium
    notes: Used for resuming a stalled session or debugging a specific action path; not officially emphasized

  - category: Latent
    component: Kernel as Browser Pool
    afforded_action: Maintain rotating browser fleet for task sharding
    discoverability: Requires Expertise
    surface_accessibility: API, CLI
    dependencies: Must handle your own session orchestration logic
    automation_resistance: Low
    notes: External orchestrators can implement horizontal scaling using Kernel as ephemeral browser-as-a-service

  - category: Latent
    component: Kernel as Serverless Function Host
    afforded_action: Deploy lightweight APIs for AI agents to invoke (e.g., scraper endpoint)
    discoverability: Requires Expertise
    surface_accessibility: API
    dependencies: Must deploy valid app and expose callable actions
    automation_resistance: Low
    notes: Works as a backend for inference-based tools or custom prompt pipelines
